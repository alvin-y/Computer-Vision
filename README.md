BlackWhite.java converts an image into black and white and then finds the number of black pixels in each connected region of the converted image.

FeatureVector.java takes an image and analyses each individual component and returns a text file containing feature vectors of each symbol.

Filter.java takes an image and applies a blur filter using convolution.

Recognize.java takes an image symbol and compares it to a feature vector text file to determine what the number is.

Scaling.java takes an input image and scales each individual symbol to a user inputted height and width

Thinning.java takes an input image and thins out each individaul symbol through the Zhang-Suen thinning algorithm.

The featurevector.txt included is only for test purposes for numbers on the recognize.java
